# ‚úä About

> Look for right people to collaborate on projects with desirable skills and good **WORK ETHICS**.

We check work ethics of a person through ``CONTRACTS`` . Before starting a project, the team lead would create a contract between the team members and that contract would be shown in each member's profile. In this way, one can check the work ethics of a person through their past contracts whether they complete projects on time, ot they delay the projects frequently or if they are habitual of breaking or ghosting contract/projects.

The site is in `PROGRESS`.

# Upcoming Features

1) **Ghost Strike Logic** :- For someone ghosting the project, team members can file a Ghost Request and if the person against whom the ghost request is registered doesn't responds within a time limit, the contract will break and it would be declared that that ghost broke the contract.

2) **Leave Chat API** :- If the contract is either broken or successful, members would have then access to exit the group chat. 

3) **Socket.io Implementation** :- For now, we havent implemented Socket.io logic due to which while sending a message in a chat, the page has to reload to show the posted messsage. To avoid this, we would implement Socket.io logic both in client and server, so that users can have a smooth messaging experience.

4) **Review System** :- After finishing the contract, team members would give reviews to other members, which would be shown in the contract for a better conclusion of one's work ethics.

5) **ActivityBox** :- We would like to show recent activities in the application, like contract creation, contract submission and more.

6) **ProfileBox** :- We are showing User's stats in the Profile Box in the Home page where we would show `Contract Stats`, `Karma` (ratings after finishing contract) and `Profile Views`. For Karma, it would be a virtual field averaging the ratings from all contracts of the user. Rest of the stats would be taken from User's model.
